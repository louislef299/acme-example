# Acme Design Demo Site

Currently working through the [Hugo in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Hugo-Action-Static-dynamic-JAMstack/dp/1617297003) book to run a test deployment of the Acme Design Company website. This project will eventually get gutted and represent my portfolio website to host as a gh page. To visit the current deployment, please visit [https://louislef299.github.io/portfolio/](https://louislef299.github.io/portfolio/).

Moved from portfolio repo.
